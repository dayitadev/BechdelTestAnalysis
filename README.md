# BechdelTestAnalysis
This analysis explores movies over time with a movies dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset) and the Bechdel Test API (https://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/doc).

The Bechdel Test is intended to measure the representation of women in film. Although the test doesn't necessarily ensure how well women are represented in a movie, it does the unique job of scoring films based on a set of criteria that provides and indication of female representation. The requirements to pass the Bechdel Test are:

1. The movies has at least 2 women in it
2. The women talk to each other
3. They talk about something other than a man.

I wanted to explore how movies have evolved over time, and was particularly interested in understanding how the Bechdel Test has scored in movies.
