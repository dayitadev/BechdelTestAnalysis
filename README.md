# BechdelTestAnalysis
This analysis explores movies over time with a movies dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset) and the Bechdel Test API (https://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/doc).

The Bechdel Test is intended to measure the representation of women in film. Although the test doesn't necessarily ensure how well women are represented in a movie, it does the unique job of scoring films based on a set of criteria that provides and indication of female representation. The requirements to pass the Bechdel Test are:

1. The movies has at least 2 women in it
2. The women talk to each other
3. They talk about something other than a man.

The Bechdel Test adds an interesting layer of data that can be use to understand female representation, or lack thereof, in movies. I wanted to explore how female representation has evolved within cinema over time; for instance, which genres pass the test more often than other and which ones fail. I also wanted to explore the correlation between gender of directors and the level of female representation in their films.

The base dataset consists of 7,100 films.
